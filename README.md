# Introduction
## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to make a portfolio project to showcase some basic data science skills.

To do this a [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project/) from Dataquest will be used.

This notebook will be a rehash of the Dataquest tutorial project. Then, in another, separate, notebook, a different project with the same format will be made.

This notebook is also available [here](https://m4rtinpf.github.io/first-post.html) (where it renders correctly, GitHub doesn't show the maps).

## Topic
The SAT scores of high-school students from New York City will be analysed, along with several demographic metrics.

The [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) is a test used in the United States to assess students' readiness for higher education. It is required to be allowed entry to many universities, so students need to do well in it.

The range of SAT scores has changed several times. For the datasets used in this notebook, the maximum score es 2400. The average SAT score of high schools is often used to rank them.

There have been claims of race or gender bias in the SAT, so this analysis will try to look into these claims.
